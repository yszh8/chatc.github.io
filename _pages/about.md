Hi~ I am Yusen Zhang, an incoming postdoc research scientist at Columbia CS, advised by broad supervisors in [DAPLab](https://daplab.cs.columbia.edu/people) (including Zhou Yu, Eugene Wu, David Blei, Daniel Hsu, and more). I obtained my PhD degree from Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). I have done industry research internships at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. I also worked closely with Dr. [Dragomir Radev](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). I received my master's degree from Emory University, advised by Dr. [Jinho D. Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html). I am fortunate to be the recipient of the SAC Award of NAACL 2025 and the Best Paper Award of a workshop at AAAI 2025.


I am also open to academic collaborations—please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together! Let's build the future of LLM together!

Research
======

My research interests lie in AI, NLP, and LLMs. Specifically, I am interested in building Distributional Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Work (AgentSociety4Work), using multi-agent systems to function as collaborative organizational entities. It involves two parts of research with diverse domains:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Scalable, efficient, trustworthy, Collaborative Large Language Model Agent systems.**  (Agent x NLP)

Fundamentally, I aim to explore how multiple language models can work together intelligently. My research focuses on the following questions:

1. How can we design mechanisms for efficient, accurate, and context-aware communication between LLMs?
2. How can we harness collective intelligence across multiple agents for complex reasoning and high-stakes decision-making?
3. What technological, ethical, and policy frameworks are needed for the responsible integration of such systems into society?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Make the Agent Systems work in real-world organizations with humans.**  

I envision agents that can operate as effective members of human organizations, collaborating with people and other agents across domains.
Key research directions include:

1. Designing reliable memory systems that enable agents to pursue long-term goals (Agent × Database)
2. Understanding why and when multi-agent systems outperform single agents (Agent × ML Theory)
3. Creating smooth human–agent collaboration in practical workflows (Agent × HCI)
4. Developing actionable agents that can use computers, perceive visual environments, and make autonomous decisions (Agent × CV/Robotics)
